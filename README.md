== General ==

These are my personally preferred keybindings on Mac OS, for use with Karabiner-Elements.
I am used to a regular (if German) keyboard layout, with Control, Alt and Alt Graph keys - the kind every other OS uses.
As such, I like my muscle memory just the way it is.

I'm sure there's a lot left to change that I've missed so far.
If you come across an inconsistency, please feel very free to open an Issue or Pull Request.

== Application ==

Karabiner's configuration files are located in ~/.config/karabiner.
These keybindings rely on the following Mac-side settings:

1) Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys...
2) Switch the Control (^) and Command (âŒ˜) keys

3) Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts
4) Add entry: [All Applications] / "Redo" / Command-Y
